# Few-Shot-Language-Agnostic-Keyword-Spotting-System-FSLAKWS-
This repository contains the source code for the Few Shot Language Agnostic Keyword Spotting System (FSLAKWS), a prototype designed to detect keywords from audio files using minimal training data. The system is capable of working across multiple languages and sample rates, making it versatile for real-world applications.
This project uses Gradio to provide an interactive web interface for users to upload audio files and get real-time keyword detection results. The audio processing is handled using librosa, a popular Python library for analyzing audio files.

Features
Audio Keyword Spotting: Upload an audio file, and the system returns detected keywords in the audio.
Language Agnostic: Works across multiple languages and varying sample rates.
Gradio Interface: Interactive and user-friendly web interface built with Gradio.
Business Use Cases: Explores use cases such as multilingual virtual assistants, customer service automation, and security surveillance.
Performance Metrics: Measures accuracy, latency, and model size, optimizing for deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Business Use Cases
The FSLAKWS system has multiple potential applications:

Multilingual Virtual Assistants: Integrates into virtual assistants to provide support across languages.
Customer Service Automation: Automatically detects important keywords in call center environments for real-time analysis.
Security and Surveillance: Enhances security systems by detecting critical keywords in multilingual environments.
Voice Biometrics: Enables language-agnostic voice-based authentication for enhanced security.
Technology Stack
Gradio: For building the web interface.
Librosa: For processing and analyzing audio data.
Python: Core programming language for developing the system.

Future Enhancements
Incorporate real-time audio processing for live keyword spotting.
Implement advanced machine learning models for higher accuracy.
Expand the system to detect more complex language patterns and phrases.
